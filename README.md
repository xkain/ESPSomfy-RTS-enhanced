## Overview

**ESPSomfy-RTS-HA-enhanced** allows you to control all your devices in Home Assistant and accurately set their position. This integration relies on an ESP32 microcontroller coupled with a cheap CC1101 transceiver module, driven by the [ESPSomfy-RTS](https://github.com/xkain/ESPSomfy-RTS) firmware.

## Requirements

This integration requires hardware running on an **ESP32** and a **CC1101** transceiver.
To assemble and configure this hardware, please refer to the **ESPSomfy-RTS** firmware [wiki](https://github.com/xkain/ESPSomfy-RTS/wiki). The radio protocol must be configured for your devices before using this integration.

## Installation

### Method 1: Via HACS (Recommended)
This integration is available directly from the HACS default store ✅

1. Click the **"Open your Home Assistant instance..."** badge above,
   or go to **HACS** → **Integrations** → **Explore & download repositories**.
2. Search for **"ESPSomfy-RTS Enhanced"**.
3. Click **Download**, then restart Home Assistant.

### Method 2: Manual Installation
Simply copy the contents of the `custom_components/espsomfy_rts_enhanced/` folder and paste it into the `config/custom_components/espsomfy_rts_enhanced/` directory of your Home Assistant instance and restart.

## Migrating from the original integration (`ESPSomfy-RTS-HA`)

If you are already using the original integration by **rstrouse**, switching to **ESPSomfy-RTS Enhanced** is done **without any loss of data, history, or automations**. Your devices will retain their unique identifiers in Home Assistant.

### Quick Migration Procedure:
1. **As a precaution:** Take a screenshot or note down the names of your current entities.
2. Remove the old `ESPSomfy-RTS-HA` integration from **HACS** (or delete the `custom_components/espsomfy_rts` folder).
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Install **ESPSomfy-RTS Enhanced** via HACS.
5. Restart Home Assistant once more.
6. If needed, rename your entities back to their original names so all your dashboards, automations, and scripts work seamlessly again.

---

### Initial Setup
Once installed and Home Assistant is restarted, the integration will **automatically discover** your radio modules on the local network. Simply navigate to **Settings** → **Devices & Services**: your ESPSomfy-RTS device will show up, ready to be configured.

---

## Features

* **Full Control**: Open, close, and set intermediate positions (percentages) directly from Home Assistant.
* **State Synchronization**: The integration tracks the real-time position of the cover, even if it is operated by a physical Somfy Telis remote or via the ESP32 web interface.
* **Simplified Updates**: You will receive a notification whenever a new version of the integration is available. Additionally, since v2.2.1 of the ESPSomfy RTS firmware, a dedicated `update` entity allows you to update your ESP32 firmware directly from the Home Assistant UI.
* **Automations**: All shades are exposed as standard `cover` entities, ready to be added to your dashboards and used in automations via native services.

## Event Management (Events)

The integration emits events on the Home Assistant event bus for every intercepted command (whether it originates from HA, a physical remote control, or the ESP web interface). These events use the `espsomfy-rts_event` type.

### Event Payload Structure

| Key | Description  |
| :--- | :--- |
| `entity_id` | The target entity ID in Home Assistant (e.g., `cover.living_room_shade`). |
| `event_key` | The event trigger (currently always set to `shadeCommand`). |
| `name` | The friendly name assigned to the device. |
| `remote_address` | The radio address defined for the motor in ESPSomfy RTS. |
| `source_address` | The source device address (remote control channel address or group address). |

### Values for `source` (Command Origin)
* `remote`: The user pressed a button on a physical remote control.
* `internal`: The command was initiated from the ESPSomfy RTS internal interface.
* `group`: The command was part of a grouped action.

### Values for `command` (Intercepted Actions)
* `Up` / `Down` / `My`: Standard commands (Up, Down, Stop/Favorite Position).
* `StepUp` / `StepDown`: Step-by-step micro-adjustments.
* `Prog`: Program button press.
* `My+Up` / `My+Down` / `Up+Down` / `My+Up+Down`: Simultaneous physical key combinations.
